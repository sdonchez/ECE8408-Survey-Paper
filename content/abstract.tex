\begin{abstract}
Satellite networks (or constellations), much like terrestrial networks, require a method for routing traffic along an optimized path from a source to a destination. This paper presents a survey of several routing algorithms that have been developed for such constellations, categorically organized based on the structure of the network itself as well as, where appropriate, the core design principles of a given group of said algorithms. The work also provides general background on the fundamental differences between satellite networks and terrestrial networks, and the implications of these differences on routing. The paper then considers the impact of "megaconstellations" such as SpaceX's Starlink, which plans to have several orders of magnitude more satellites than most current constellations. The paper concludes by discussing some avenues for continued research into the enhancement of such algorithms in the future, which will be critical as the world continues to move toward the use of satellite networks for high-throughput applications in everyday life.
