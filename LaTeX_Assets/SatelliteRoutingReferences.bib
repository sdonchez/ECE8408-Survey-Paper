	abstract = {Satellite networks have many advantages over traditional terrestrial networks. However, it is very difficult to design a satellite network with excellent performance. The paper briefly summarizes some existing satellite network routing technologies from the perspective of both single-layer and multilayer satellite constellations, and focuses on the main ideas, characteristics, and existing problems of these routing technologies. For single-layer satellite networks, two routing strategies are discussed, virtual node strategy and virtual topology strategy. Moreover, considering the deficiency of existing multilayer satellite network routing, we discuss the topic invulnerability. Finally, the challenges and problems faced by the satellite network are analyzed and the trend of future development is predicted.},

	abstract = {Satellite systems are going to build a part of the future personal communications infrastructure. The first-generation candidates for satellite personal communication networks (S-PCN) will rely on low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) constellations. A noticeable trend in this field is toward broadband services and the use of ATM. For LEO satellite systems employing intersatellite links (ISLs), this paper proposes an overall networking concept that introduces the strengths of ATM to their operation. The core of the paper is the design of a new routing scheme for the periodically time-variant ISL subnetwork, discrete-time dynamic virtual topology routing (DT-DVTR), and its ATM implementation. DT-DVTR works completely off line, i.e., prior to the operational phase of the system. In a first step, a virtual topology is set up for all successive time intervals of the system period, providing instantaneous sets of alternative paths between all source-destination node pairs. In the second step, path sequences over a series of time interval are chosen from that according to certain optimization procedures. An ATM-based implementation of DT-DVTR in LEO satellite ISL networks is presented with some emphasis on the optimization alternatives, and the performance in terms of delay jitter is evaluated for an example ISL topology.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for the link assignment (i.e., topological design) problem that arises from the use of intersatellite links (ISL's) in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. In the proposed framework, we model an LEO satellite network as a finite state automaton (FSA), where each state corresponds to an equal-length interval in the system period of the LEO satellite network. This FSA-based framework allows the link assignment problem in LEO satellite networks to be treated as a set of link assignment problems in fixed topology networks. Within this framework, we study various link assignment and routing schemes. In particular, both regular link assignment and link assignment optimized by simulated annealing are considered. For each link assignment, both static and dynamic routing schemes are considered. Our simulation results show that the optimized link assignment combined with static routing achieves the best performance in terms of both newly initiated call blocking probability and ongoing call blocking probability. The results also show that when the link assignment is the same, static routing gives better performance than dynamic routing since the latter requires a substantial amount of time to stabilize its routing table after a state transition.},

Due to lower system delay and lower power consumption in mobile terminal, LEO satellite communication will undoubtedly become an important development direction in satellite communication system in the future. In satellite communication networks, routing algorithms determine average delay and the average of traffic load thereby have significant influences on the performance of the system. In this paper, a novel routing algorithm based on virtual topology snapshot has been proposed and it inherits the advantage of lower delay in topology snapshot as well as solves the problems of poor robustness and adaptability. This algorithm has been proved more excellent performance than topology snapshot routing and distributed routing algorithm via simulation.},

On the other hand, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems play an irreplaceable role in real-time applications. But if local terrestrial terminals want to connect to the rest of the world, a lot of satellite devices are demanded. In this paper, we divide two kinds of packet individually representing real-time and non-real time traffic. According to their different demands, we take advantage of both GEO and LEO. The purpose of the paper is to avoid long delay caused by congestion to real-time traffic and minimize packet loss damage caused by queuing. We introduced a data-based mechanism in the under layer. Firstly, we optimize Dijkstra algorithm, we forward packets from different layer through the hybrid network according the congestion of the current hop. In this way, we decrease the delay for real-time traffic. Then we use modified short-hop algorithm based on region partition as an alternate path to balance the network traffic and to decrease the delay caused by queuing.},

On the other hand, satellite network users are unevenly distributed and satellite nodes move rapidly, causing local congestion in satellite networks. Many domestic and foreign researchers proposed many solutions for single-layer satellite network routing in view of the above, but they still need to be supplemented and improved in handling multi-layer satellite network routing. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the dynamics of satellite movement, consider the optimization of satellite topology, reduce the unnecessary topology snapshot switching to improve the efficiency of satellite system. In addition, many satellite network routing algorithms perform routing table computation through dynamic information collection, lacking corresponding load balancing mechanisms. In this paper, a new scheme for load-balanced cooperative data transmission scheme in LEO/MEO satellite is proposed, in which the two-layer satellite topology is optimized and the corresponding congestion control mechanism is provided to provide QoS satellite service.},
