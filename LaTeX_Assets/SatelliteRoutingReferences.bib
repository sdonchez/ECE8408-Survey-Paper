	title = {A survey of routing techniques for satellite networks},
	abstract = {Satellite networks have many advantages over traditional terrestrial networks. However, it is very difficult to design a satellite network with excellent performance. The paper briefly summarizes some existing satellite network routing technologies from the perspective of both single-layer and multilayer satellite constellations, and focuses on the main ideas, characteristics, and existing problems of these routing technologies. For single-layer satellite networks, two routing strategies are discussed, virtual node strategy and virtual topology strategy. Moreover, considering the deficiency of existing multilayer satellite network routing, we discuss the topic invulnerability. Finally, the challenges and problems faced by the satellite network are analyzed and the trend of future development is predicted.},
